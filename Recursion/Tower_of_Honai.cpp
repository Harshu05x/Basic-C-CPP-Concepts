//Q] Tower of Honai --> 
/*Initially, all the disks are placed on one rod, 
one over the other in ascending order of size similar to a cone-shaped tower. 
The objective of this problem is to move the stack of disks from the initial rod to
another rod, following these rules: 
1]A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
2]Move one disk at a time.
The goal is to move all the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod. 
To move N disks from one rod to another, 2^ùëÅ‚àí1 steps are required.
So, to move 3 disks from starting the rod to the ending rod, a total of 7 steps are required.*/
